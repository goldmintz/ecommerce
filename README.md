## Limitations & Suggested Improvements
As noted above, the focus of this project was functionality, especially building out Redux state management and MongoDB integration. I wanted to build as complex an experience as I could, given my limited development experience. For that reason, the design took a backseat. 

### Design
This project would have greatly benefitted from a style guide at the start. I didn't anticipate the feature list growing, which left the design sort of limping along. I'm on the fence about whether I'd use react-bootstap again. Candidly, the biggest (and possibly only) benefit was the responsive layout based in rows and columns. That said, a solid style guide and more upfront work on my part could have eliminated this clunky library altogether.


### Engineering
Custom error messaging and additional validation on the front-end would be an improvement. Because this is a portfolio project, I decided to skip this in several components because I felt I understood its implementation elsewhere. 

Having vastly improved as a developer over the course of this project, I'd also go back and clean up some functions just for formatting sake. However, they get the job done!
